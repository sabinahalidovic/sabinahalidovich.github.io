                <h3> Hello!</h3>
                <p>
                    My name Is Sabina Halidovic. I am a first year student majoring in Software Engineering at FSCE FINKI.
                    I chose to major in software engineering because of my passion for technology and the limitless possibilities it offers.
                    From a young age, I found myself fascinated by computers, their functionality, and their ability to solve complex problems.
                    As I delved deeper into the world of technology, I realized that software engineering is at the heart of innovation
                    and drives progress in various industries.

                <h3> Photography</h3>
                <p>
                    Apart from my passion for programming, I do photography.
                    My passion for photography started in my second year of high school, as we had many clubs to choose from I chose the photography club.
                    I had the opportunity to visit places with my school and show my experience to others through my lens.
                    As any other individual has taken a photo it always has a background thought through it,
                    as one would say every image has a story.
