            <h3> Places i have visited</h3>
            <p>
                The first country i visited in my life was Switzerland, i stayed in Dietikon, a small town where it is filled with hundreds 
                of nationalities, cultures etc. Over my stay there i visited the big amusement park in Zurich, the tallest building in Zurich, 
                The Feschta where it is a long line of fresh street food. 
                My favorite place i visted as i said before is Italy, unforgettable people, culture, memories. sights. The Pisa is magnificent, 
                Napoli is a beautiful historical place, i can confirm they make the best pizza there.
                My experience in these two beautiful conuntries will forever remain in my heart, the people are so nice, the streets clean,
                amazing manners of everyone there.
                My third traveling experience that is worth talking about is Bosna and Herzegovina. As a Bosnian myself, i am very proud of my countru
                and the people there, the culture is so beautiful, the food is delicious, the warmth of home. Mostar is a very astonishing historical city.
                The bridge is breathtaking.

                <li>For up-to-date information on 'safe' and 'unsafe' areas of the city, consult with your hotel manager or local tourist information officer.</li>
                <li>Try to blend in with the locals and avoid looking or acting like a tourist.</li>
                <li>If you are mugged, don't fight back. It is better to lose a few dollars and a wristwatch than get injured.</li>
