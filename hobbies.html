    As long as the academic knowledge and my passion of photography go, I have established hobbies and skills from a young age.
    One of my favorite hobbies was art.
    Art is one of the best forms u can express yourself without saying anything, just as I said every image has a story, every painting has its story as well.
    In middle school I was nominated as the best painter in my class, my art was shown to multiple teachers, classmates, family, friends and strangers.
    As the years went by I kept getting better at it with amazing mentors by my side.
    One of my favorite places to explore my vision of art is in nature.
    I can proudly say this is one of my favorite skill I have, to point with a free  mind,
    free will and being self-taught from the age of 7.

        My second hobby is sport, clich√© but it is one of my healthiest habits too.
        Health is the most important thing in life.
        I did sport as a hobby since I was very young, I played volleyball, basketball, running.
        Running was my favorite out of every sport. It is one of my nest skills. Running small or big marathons it fills every void.
        I won 4 competitions.
        I started training when I was 8 years old, and as the years went by I got faster and faster at running.

<p class="descriprion">
    The third hobby would be music, specifically playing the guitar.
    I grew up in an area where people did everything with music, cleaned their houses, went on car rides,
    read a book while playing music etc.
    I have loved music since forever, when I was younger my favorite singer was Justin Bieber, I have to say he inspired me to try playing
    the guitar because he was very good at it.
    I am grateful to be able to play such an amazing instrument, it wasnt easy but I got to a point where it is one of my best skills I have.

        For last, traveling is my fourth hobby. No matter wether it is by car, plane, or train, count me in.
        The thought of going to different places boost me with serotonin. 
        Traveling gives me a good opportunity to learn a lot about the history of the each country I visit, to see cultural
        and historical places, to meet people of different nationalities, and to learn a lot about their traditions, customs and culture.
        In other words. I can expand my worldview and my mind. My favortie place i visted was Italy, the colosseum will forever be uin my heart.
        Such beautiful architecture all over the country. Their food is fantastic and the unforgettable culture.
